# ASTRA

**A**utonomous **S**trategic **Tr**aining **A**gent

ASTRA is an AI agent system that orchestrates end-to-end ML/RL training autonomously. You set the goal; ASTRA plans, implements, sandboxes, trains, evaluates, and iterates until the target metric is reached.

## Feature Highlights

- **Fully autonomous loop** — Plan → Implement → Sandbox → Train → Evaluate → Refine, driven by an LLM planner with no human intervention required
- **GAN-style self-critique** — a CriticAgent scores every plan on safety, complexity, and overfitting risk before code is written; the LeadAgent revises on low scores
- **Smart KV cache** — three-bucket context window (system / code / history) with sliding-window eviction so long runs never blow the token budget
- **Recipe crystallization & evolution** — completed missions are distilled into versioned YAML recipes; recipes can be mutated, selected, and promoted to "Golden" status after consecutive wins
- **Semantic warm-start** — ChromaDB recipe library retrieves the closest prior strategy before each new plan, reducing wasted iterations
- **Atomic requirement manifests** — structured pass/fail requirements (stability, artifacts, metric thresholds) replace free-text goals; the loop only completes when all are green
- **Clean handoff protocol** — every iteration writes a `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` capturing the last action, current blocker, and exact next step for reliable warm-restart
- **Multi-sandbox execution** — SubprocessSandbox (Apple Silicon Metal) or ContainerSandbox (Docker/CUDA); SandboxManager auto-selects and handles GPU pool assignment
- **Live mission HUD** — Next.js dashboard with real-time metric charts, log stream, pivot timeline, and critic trace; WebSocket back-fills history on reconnect
- **143 tests** — unit coverage across all core services (evolution, KV cache, crystallizer, preflight, state recovery, etc.) plus integration tests for the full loop

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Create and activate the virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Download local MLX models (required for first run)
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct-4bit
huggingface-cli download mlx-community/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct-4bit

# 4. Configure environment
cp .env.example .env   # edit as needed

# 5. Apply database migrations
alembic upgrade head

# 6. Run
make run   # backend + frontend → http://localhost:8200 / http://localhost:3200
```

API docs available at `http://localhost:8200/docs` once the backend is running.

## Hardware Target

Optimized for **Apple Silicon M4, 24 GB unified memory**.

Training sandboxes run locally by default (subprocess using the project `.venv`). To offload training to a remote machine over SSH, set `ASTRA_SANDBOX_HOST` and optionally `ASTRA_SANDBOX_PYTHON` in `.env`.

| Machine | Role | Models / Load |
|---|---|---|
| MacBook M4 24 GB | MLX inference (Lead + Critic agents) + orchestration + local sandbox | Llama-3.1-8B-4bit (~4.5 GB) + Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-4bit (~4 GB) ≈ 8.5 GB |
| mac-mini M4 24 GB (optional) | Remote training execution via SSH | Full 24 GB available for training subprocess |

GPU training runs as a restricted host subprocess (Metal is not accessible inside Docker on Apple Silicon). Docker is used for cloud/CUDA targets only.
